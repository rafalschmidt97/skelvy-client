## Idea

The idea for Skelvy is extremely simple as it a tool for arranging and finding meetings over favourite activities in the city. Users log in to the app, fill in the meeting parameters with when, where and what they are planning or simply would like to do. Meetings always might be open to the public so other people in the area would see them in their explore tab.
